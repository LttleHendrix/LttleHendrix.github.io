                This is a project I made in my Artificial Intelligence class. It is a game in which a player is dropped into a box, 
                and navigate around looking for the pizza, while trying to avoid walking into walls. I made two computer players for this 
                project, one that moves around essentially randomly until the pizza is found, and one that avoids repeating moves to 
                find the pizza quicker. This is where my love for AI began, and this sort of logic was the basis for my Chess Engine 
                that I would later work on.

                Here is the 
                <a href="https://github.com/LttleHendrix/PizzaFinder">source code</a>
                for this project
            </p>
            <p class="cell small-7 large-7">
                The logic involved in the Pizza Finder project has shaped the way that I think about coding. Having a goal and taking 
                clear and direct steps in an organized way to get there made sense to me in a new way through Artificial Intelligence. 
                This process manifests itself in different ways, but is still very present in the Classy Schedule project.
