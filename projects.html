                A project that I have been working on in my free time is a chess AI. There are still some bugs in the current version 
                and in the future I will do a complete rewrite, but in its current form it plays around a 700 level (as long as it doesn't 
                crash). The program is written in Java as it is the language I have the most experience in. The hardest part about 
                designing a chess computer is the time complexity of the algorithms used to select the next move, optimizing algorithms 
                to look far enough into the future in a fast enough time is a challenge.

                To be able to work on my chess bot I had to first learn how artificial intelligence worked. I did this in the artificial 
                intelligence class that I took in in Spring of 2021. Here is a project we did in that class in which there was a 
                maze and only one tile away is visible. The AI is able to move around with some level of intelligence and find the pizza.
                This sort of intelligent thinking was the baseline for my chess project and all that will follow

            <p class="cell small-7 large-7">
                Another artificial intelligeance project that I have worked on is a bot to play pokemon. There is significant work 
                left in this project, but at a baseline it can play the game, interact with obstacles and enemies, and progress 
                throughout the game, however slowly.
